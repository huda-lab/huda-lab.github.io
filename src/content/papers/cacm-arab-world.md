Misinformation and disinformation pose significant risks globally, with the Arab region facing unique vulnerabilities due to geopolitical instabilities, linguistic diversity, and cultural nuances. We explore these challenges through the key facets of combating misinformation: detection, tracking, mitigation, and community engagement. We shed light on how connecting with grassroots fact-checking organizations, understanding cultural norms, promoting social correction, and creating strong collaborative information networks can create opportunities for a more resilient information ecosystem in the Arab world.
